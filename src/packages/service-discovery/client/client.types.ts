/**
 * =============================================================================
 * SERVICE DISCOVERY CLIENT - TYPE DEFINITIONS
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * This file contains all TypeScript type definitions for the service discovery
 * client library. The client handles service registration, heartbeat management,
 * service discovery with caching, and load balancing.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Registration: Announcing your service to the discovery server
 * - Heartbeat: Periodic "I'm alive" messages to maintain registration
 * - Discovery: Finding and connecting to other services by name
 * - Caching: Local storage of service lists for performance
 * - Load Balancing: Random selection among available service instances
 * =============================================================================

// CLIENT CONFIGURATION TYPES
// =============================================================================

/**
 * ServiceDiscoveryClientOptions - Configuration options for creating a client instance
 *
 * These options control the behavior of the service discovery client,
 * including timing, caching, and network settings.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const client = new ServiceDiscoveryClient('http://localhost:3000', {
 *   defaultHeartbeatInterval: 45,  // Send heartbeat every 45 seconds
 *   cacheMultiplier: 3,            // Cache services for 3x heartbeat interval
 *   requestTimeout: 10000          // 10 second HTTP timeout
 * });
 * ```

// =============================================================================
// USAGE EXAMPLES AND PATTERNS
// =============================================================================

/**
 * COMMON USAGE PATTERNS:
 *
 * 1. SERVICE REGISTRATION AND HEARTBEATS:
 *    ```typescript
 *    const client = new ServiceDiscoveryClient('http://localhost:3000');
 *
 *    // Register service
 *    await client.register('my-service', 3001);
 *    // Client automatically sends heartbeats
 *
 *    // Check registration status
 *    const isRegistered = client.isServiceRegistered();
 *    const serviceInfo = client.getCurrentService();
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. SERVICE DISCOVERY WITH LOAD BALANCING:
 *    ```typescript
 *    // Get URL for any healthy instance of user-service
 *    const userServiceUrl = await client.getServiceUrl('user-service');
 *    // Returns: "http://192.168.1.10:3001" (random selection)
 *
 *    // Make request to discovered service
 *    const response = await axios.get(`${userServiceUrl}/api/users`);
 *    ```
 *
 * 3. CACHE MANAGEMENT:
 *    ```typescript
 *    // Check cache status
 *    const cacheStatus = client.getCacheStatus();
 *    console.log('User service cache:', cacheStatus['user-service']);
 *
 *    // Force cache refresh
 *    client.clearCache();
 *    const freshUrl = await client.getServiceUrl('user-service');
 *    ```
 *
 * 4. HEALTH MONITORING:
 *    ```typescript
 *    // Check if discovery server is available
 *    const health = await client.healthCheck();
 *    if (health.status === 'unhealthy') {
 *       // Handle discovery server outage
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * 5. GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN:
 *    ```typescript
 *    // Cleanup when service shuts down
 *    process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
 *       await client.unregister();
 *       process.exit(0);
 *    });
 *    ```
 *
 * 6. ADVANCED CONFIGURATION:
 *    ```typescript
 *    const client = new ServiceDiscoveryClient('http://localhost:3000', {
 *       defaultHeartbeatInterval: 60,  // 1 minute heartbeats
 *       cacheMultiplier: 3,            // Cache for 3 minutes
 *       requestTimeout: 10000          // 10 second timeout
 *    });
 *    ```
